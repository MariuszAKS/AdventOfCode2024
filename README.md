After pulling this project, create folders in project's root: inputs/ and outputs/.
Inside inputs/ store input files for each day named as "day_xx.txt" where xx is a day number (01, 02, ..., 09, 10, ..., 25).
Folder outputs/ is there for tasks that involve looking at the results, such as day 14 part 2 (looking for a christmas tree).
